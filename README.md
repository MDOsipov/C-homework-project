# Snake game
### Features of the game:
- Written based on Win API
- Consists of three key files:
    - homework.c - main file with function realizations
    - structs.h - file with used stuctures definitions
    - definitions.h - file that defines game metrics and parameters as well as created functions
- Code written in a generic way, e.g., every item in the game (a snake part, a fruit) is being created based on just one core structure which makes adding new features to the game easier
- Array data structure is choosen to represent a set of snake parts and fruits as it provides the fastest way to access elements required
