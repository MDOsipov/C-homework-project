# Snake game
### Features of the game:
- Created based on Win API
- Contains of three files:
    - homework.c - main file with function realizations
    - structs.h - file with used stuctures definitions
    - definitions.h - file that defines game metrics and parameters as well as game functions
- Code written in a generic way, i.e. every item in the game (snake parts, fruits) created based on just one structure which makes adding new features to the game easier
